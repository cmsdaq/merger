## This files contains rules for rsync filter
##
## USAGE:
##   rsync -F <source> <destination>
##
## From the man page: 
#
#     -F : The -F option is a shorthand [...] for this rule:
#
#          --filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter'
#
#     This tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files 
#     that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules 
#     to filter the files in the transfer.
